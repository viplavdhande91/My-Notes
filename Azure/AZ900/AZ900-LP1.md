# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe cloud concepts

### ***Azure Arc*** :
- Azure Arc is a **set of technologies** that helps **manage your cloud environment**. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's  
  - a public cloud solely on Azure
  - a private cloud in your datacenter
  - a hybrid configuration (More than one public cloud providerers involved), 
  - or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.
### ***CapEx*** and ***OpEx***: 
  -  ***CapEx***: It is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure to purchase or secure tangible resources. A new building, repaving the parking lot, building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle are examples of CapEx.

  - ***OpEx***: It is spending money on services or products over time. Renting a convention center, leasing a company vehicle, or signing up for cloud services are all examples of OpEx.

  - Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model. With cloud computing, you don’t pay for the physical infrastructure, the electricity, the security, or anything else associated with maintaining a datacenter. Instead, you pay for the IT resources you use. If you don’t use any IT resources this month, you don’t pay for any IT resources.

### **Scalability**:
 
  - > ***Vertical scaling***
    With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could **vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM** to the virtual machine. Conversely, if you realized you had over-specified the needs, you could vertically scale down by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications. 
 
   - > ***Horizontal scaling***
     With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually). For example, **you could add additional virtual machines or containers**, scaling out. In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.


###  **Reliability**
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 

### **Predictability**
   Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability. 

- ***Performance***
Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
- ***Cost***
By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed. You can even use tools like the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** or **Pricing Calculator** to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

### ***Managebility***
- ***Management of the cloud:***
  Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:

  - **Automatically scale** resource deployment based on need.
  - Deploy resources based on a **preconfigured template**, removing the need for manual configuration.
  - **Monitor the health** of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
  - **Receive automatic alerts** based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.

- ***Management in the cloud***
  Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:

  - Through a web portal.
  - Using a command line interface.
  - Using APIs.
  - Using PowerShell.
