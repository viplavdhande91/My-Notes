# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe Azure Architecture and Services

## Terminologies
- **Regions**: Geographical areas containing at least one datacenter, networked together with low-latency. Example: West Europe.
- **Availability Zones**: Physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. Example: Sweden.

## Azure Regions and Availability Zones

- **Note**: A minimum of three availability zones ensure resiliency in availability zone-enabled regions. Not all regions support availability zones.

### Region Pairs
- Most regions are paired with another within the same geography, at least 300 miles apart, to reduce interruption risks.

- **Note**: Not all services automatically replicate data across regions. Configuration is required for recovery and replication.

Advantages of Region Pairs:
- One region is prioritized during extensive outages.
- Planned updates are rolled out one region at a time.
- Data resides within the same geography for jurisdiction purposes.

- **Note**: Some regions have one-direction pairings. Example: West India (primary) with South India (secondary); South India with Central India. Brazil South is paired with South Central US.

### Sovereign Regions
Isolated instances of Azure for compliance or legal purposes.

Azure sovereign regions include:
- **US Government**: US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, US Gov Iowa.
- **China**: China East, China North (managed by 21Vianet).

## Management Groups
- **Note**: Resource groups cannot be nested, but management groups can.

Important Facts:
- Support up to 10,000 management groups in a single directory.
- Management group trees can have up to six levels (excluding root and subscription levels).
- Each management group and subscription can only have one parent.
